# Solar Energy Potential Analysis

This project analyzes and visualizes solar energy potential using ArcGIS Pro. It leverages tools like **Area Solar Radiation** to calculate solar energy potential and integrates terrain and land use data for suitability analysis.

## Features

- **Solar Radiation Analysis**: Calculates potential solar radiation over a given area.
- **Suitability Mapping**: Identifies areas suitable for solar energy installations.
- **3D Visualization**: Creates realistic 3D models for better communication.
- **Exportable Maps and Reports**: Provides ready-to-share outputs.

## Requirements

- ArcGIS Pro 3.0 or higher.
- Digital Elevation Model (DEM).
- Solar radiation data or the ability to generate it using the **Area Solar Radiation** tool.
- Land use/land cover data.
